<h3>How to Protect Yourself When Going Out</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.</li>
    <li>Choose a mask with two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric that fits snugly against the sides of your face.</li>
    <li>Stay 6 feet apart and avoid crowds.</li>
    <li>The more people you are in contact with, the more likely you are to be exposed to COVID-19.</li>
    <li>Avoid indoor spaces as much as possible, particularly ones that aren’t well ventilated.</li>
    <li>You may find it harder to stay 6 feet apart in indoor spaces.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands often.</li>
    <li>Use soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place or hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.</li>
</ul>
